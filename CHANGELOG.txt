1.5.0 - Adding /kill_safari end point to kill instance of Safari Browser
      - Fixing the /kill_firefox endpoint, it was broken for some reason
1.4.0 - Modifying system timeouts, such as browser idle timeout, new session timeout, and grid status checking timeouts
      - When launching grid, use absolute path to java not just "java" alias which might not be declared in the PATH if you are using a Daemon (Non Windows OS only)
1.3.3 - Fixed an issue where the node will attempt to reboot and will be stuck in an endless loop trying to kill safari and never rebooting. Fixing the issue by commenting out the kill browsers command and just sending a reboot command
1.3.2 - Fixing a bug where node config JSON have all Integers converted to Doubles by Gson, which prevents nodes from starting
1.3.1 - When sending config to HUB and reciving it from HUB, parse the config and pretty print it into the file
      - Performance improvment in the tests, don't try to ping hub asking for local box's info when in test mode
1.3.0 - Nodes store all of the configs on the HUB and update from the HUB everytime they are started
      - Switching to Semantic Versioning
      - Adding ability to reboot grid node after a certain session limit has been reached.
      - Removed log4j from the proxy, it seems to bottleneck requests
      - Update the new session timeout setting to be 2 minutes instead of infinite
1.2.4 - Added ability to self update all of the drivers if a new version was released
      - Adding Safari as a capability
      - Add the host ip back into the mix, by adding it as a CLI flag that is generated on the fly
      - Write example of config file to file system to see what can be overwritten
      - Update URL for new WD locations
      - Add ability to pass JVM args into the node starters and grid extras
      - Bump up the registration cycle so the nodes are not spamming the HUB
1.2.3 - Take out "host" out of node config. The boot time for each node will be slightly longer
        However, it will be much simpler to copy paste same config file on many nodes and not
        have to edit each node 1 by 1
1.2.2 - All of the System.out statments now write to log/log.out
      - Install self as a crontab service on Windows/Mac/Linux boxes
      - Crontab service checks if all the nodes are up and running, if any down starts them up
      - Remove Webdriver Jar from packed dependencies, reducing artifact size from 32MB to 4MB
        (Webdriver Jar gets downloaded by this jar automatically, and when started uses this jar
         in the classpath to get access to servlettes etc...)
1.2.1 - Output node and hub logs into the shared directory for easy review
      - Tweak node registration cycle to work better when node dies

1.1.3 - Implement Start Grid Hub/Node commands on windows
1.1.2 - Updates to make GUI in browser look nicer
1.1.1 - First time run asks questions about config
1.1.0 - Adding ability to kill by pid
      - Adding Netstat call to list busy ports
      - Ability to start/stop Selenium grid hub and nodes
1.0.3 - Fix bug with /api end point not returning any values
1.0.2 - Add default config writing, so you can start with a naked jar and it will set itself up
1.0.1 - Roll up all the Lib dependencies into single jar, so now just download jar file and no need to do full git clone
1.0.0 - Initial release
